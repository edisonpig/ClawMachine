This is a Unity Project I made using Unity, along with CineMachine and other elements for a simple claw machine game. <br><br><br>
The game has both pc and mobile enabled. <br><br><br>

For PC, arrow keys are used to control the claw's movement and the spacebar is used to control whether the claw should go down.<br>
The left mouse button is used to skip prize viewing.<br><br>

For Mobile, rotate your device for the best experience.<br> Use the buttons for controlling the claw and tap anywhere to skip prize viewing.<br><br><br>


As a huge fan of Japanese arcade culture, I want to recreate the arcade environment with the aid of the game engine.<br>
Hope you enjoy!
